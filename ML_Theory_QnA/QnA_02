Types of Parameters
Parameters
Model Parameters
These are the parameters of the model that can be determined by training with training data. These can be considered as internal Parameters.
Weights
Bias
y = w*x + b
Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters are parameters whose values control the learning process. These are adjustable parameters used to obtain an optimal model.
External Parameters.

Learning rate
Number of Epochs
n_estimators


Hyperparameter Tuning refers to the process of choosing the optimum set of hyperparameters for a Machine Learning model. This process is also
called Hyperparameter Optimization.
