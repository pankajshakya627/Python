Python libraries like pandas, numpy, and regex can be used for these tasks.

12. **Question:** Have you dealt with scraping data from websites that implement AJAX calls to fetch data asynchronously?
    **Answer:** Yes, I have experience scraping data from websites that use AJAX calls. By monitoring network traffic and inspecting the AJAX requests made by the website, I can identify the relevant API endpoints and parameters required to retrieve the desired data. I can then send requests to these endpoints and extract the data returned in the JSON or XML format.

13. **Question:** Can you explain how you would handle rate limiting or throttling when scraping websites?
    **Answer:** Rate limiting or throttling is implemented by websites to prevent excessive scraping and ensure fair usage. To handle rate limiting, I would implement mechanisms such as adding delays between requests, setting request headers to simulate human-like behavior, or monitoring the HTTP response headers for rate limit information. Additionally, using a distributed approach with multiple IP addresses or rotating proxies can help overcome rate limiting restrictions.

14. **Question:** How do you stay updated with the latest trends and techniques in web scraping?
